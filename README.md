# SpaceX Viewer (Jersey/JAX-RS Demonstration)

This is a simple demonstration application to show how an Eclipse Rich Client Platform application can use Jersey/JAX-RS to communicate with REST services. It has intentionally been kept as simple as possible to keep the focus on the remote service calls.

## Installation Steps

1. In Eclipse (with RCP tooling installed), clone this repository and import the projects into your workspace.

2. Open the **spacex.target** file in the **com.modumind.spacex.app** project. Click the **Set as Active Target** link after the target resolves.

3. Open the **spacex.product** file in the **com.modumind.spacex.app** project. Click the **Launch an Eclipse Application** link. You should see a window displaying the SpaceX data.
